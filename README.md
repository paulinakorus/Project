# News Aggregation Platform
Final project for Volvo .NET Academy

The service has been designed to gather news information from various English-language popular science articles pertaining to all kinds of disabilities. It extracts their core content, evaluates their "positivity" in terms of readability and relevance of the article. 

## Disabilities category and content
This includes categorizing sources based on types of disabilities (e.g., cognitive disabilities, physical disabilities) and the types of content the articles contain, such as rehabilitation, symptoms, daily life, etc. 

## Opinion and searching
Additionally, users can provide opinions and rate the most important aspects of the source. Moreover, users accessing the platform will have the ability to browse news information rated according to configurable basic "positivity". Authorized users have the privilege to customize these metrics to align with their preferences. 

## Additional function
The service also includes an administrative interface, facilitating interaction with ongoing operations such as news editing, comment moderation, and related functions.
